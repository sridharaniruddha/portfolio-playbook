## User Story

As a developer, I want to create a portfolio website that can be used to showcase my skills and my work. I want to keep adding projects to the site in the future as I work on more projects. 

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
*When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and my contact channels.
*When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
*When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications
*When presented with my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
*When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
*When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
